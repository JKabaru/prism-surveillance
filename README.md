# PRISM: Predictive Risk & Instability Surveillance Module

**PRISM** is an AI-powered forensic intelligence platform designed to detect coordinated fraud, behavioral anomalies, and proactive regime shifts in high-frequency trading and affiliate networks.

---

## 🛡️ Key Features

- **Temporal Correlation Engine:** Detects "Mirror Trading" rings by identifying sub-second synchronized trade clusters.
- **Behavioral Intelligence:** Flags "Bonus Abuse" and "Commission Inflation" patterns through automated trade profiling.
- **Proactive Regime Monitoring:** Uses Z-Score baseline analysis to detect "Sleeper Agents" before they scale fraudulent activities.
- **Investigation Workbench:** Interactive Nexus Graphs, cross-affiliate attribution, and automated evidence synthesis.
- **Agentic Pipeline:** A transparent "Glass-Box" reasoning engine that automates forensic data traversal and case management.
