## 📋 Basic Information

- **Project Title:** PRISM: Predictive Risk & Instability Surveillance Module
- **Short Description:** An AI-powered forensic intelligence platform for detecting coordinated fraud rings and proactive regime shifts in affiliate networks.
- **Long Description:** 
  PRISM (Predictive Risk & Instability Surveillance Module) is a next-generation surveillance suite designed for high-frequency financial and affiliate networks. It addresses the growing challenge of coordinated fraud by combining temporal correlation engines with proactive behavioral monitoring.

  Key innovations include:
  1. **Temporal Correlation:** Detecting "Mirror Trading" rings by clustering sub-second trade synchronization.
  2. **Regime Monitoring:** Identifying "Sleeper Agents" through Z-score baseline deviation analysis before they exit the ecosystem.
  3. **Glass-Box Reasoning:** A transparent agentic pipeline that provides a full audit trail of the AI's forensic traversal.
  4. **Investigation Workbench:** Interactive Nexus Graphs and automated evidence synth briefs (HTML/PDF) for compliance teams.

- **Technology & Category Tags:** 
  `Financial Forensics`, `AI/LLM`, `Fraud Detection`, `Python`, `Streamlit`, `Network Analysis`, `Autonomous Agents`, `Explainable AI`

## 🛠️ Dev Notes for Submission
- **Why PRISM?** Traditional fraud detection is reactive. PRISM is proactive, flagging "behavioral flips" before losses scale.
- **AI Integration:** Uses LLMs not just for chat, but for synthesizing complex multi-dimensional evidence into legal-grade hypotheses.
- **Transparency:** The "Agentic Feed" ensures every automated freeze or escalation is backed by a visible logic chain.
